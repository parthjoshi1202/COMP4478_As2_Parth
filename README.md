In this game I used Prefabs of the card sprite (blank.jpg) to make a memory game called cartoon character in Unity 2D. I created a 4x4 screen with blank cards. 
If the user flips two unmatched cards these cards would flip, and user would play another round. If they are 2 matched cards, they disappear. 
Once all characters are identified, 
a Game over Scene is loaded with an option to play again where the characters would have different positions as compared to the previous session.
